            Topic: 
                School Budgets problem from DrivenData.org
                School budgets are huge, complex and non-standardized within the US
                School want to measure their performance
            Goal: 
                Build Machine Learning Algorithm that automate the labeling of spendings
            Data:
                Line-Data with description:
                like "Algebra books for 8th grade students"
                Labels attached like: "Math", "Middle School", "Textbooks"
            Type of the problem:
                Supervised Learning Problem -> Using correct labeled data to predict the label of an unlabeled sample
                predict the label -> Classification problem
                predict the probability of each target variables possible value (logreg?)
            Specials:
                Over 100 target variables
                9 columns with several possible Labels
                predicting variable-value-probabilities via dummy variables
            Exploring the data:
                Loading dataset via:
